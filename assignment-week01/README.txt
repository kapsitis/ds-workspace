Recommended Steps 
==================

1. Create file main.cpp in this directory (it should be the solution to Question 4 from the written assignment on Week01). 
2. Complete the assignment - read positive integer numbers (until you see 0). For each number call a function 
   with a single integer argument and a single return value. 
3. Create an input file (file contains some positive integers separated by spaces; and ends with "0"). 
4. Compile and test your solution. For example, like this: 
   main.exe < input.txt
5. Verify that it works correctly (numbers < 100 are unchanged, but larger ones have their 2nd and 3rd digits from the right swapped). 
   For example 1234 becomes 1324. And 100 becomes 10 (since the 3rd digit from the right is now "0": 100 -> 010). 
6. Run more tests, if you wish. Commit and push your repository.
